# Scheduled Tasks
#
# Daily:
#   - update_incomplete_stages: legacy onboarding sweep (pre-existing)
#   - run_daily_actions: SP daily housekeeping (scheduler.py)
#   - check_auto_activate: SP — auto-activates BPRs whose batch.start_date has
#                          arrived; seeds next_action_at on PEs so the per-PE
#                          dispatcher has work. See task #19 for details.
#
# Cron:
#   - */1 * * * *  — pe_dispatcher: per-PE event-driven dispatcher (task #15);
#                    processes overdue next_action_at, routes by next_action_type.
#                    Tightened from */2 to */1 min for the 100K-student MVP target
#                    (architecture §8.8 + ADR-003 audit log 2026-05-13). Combined
#                    with DISPATCH_BATCH_SIZE=1000 and 4 parallel workers gives
#                    240K actions/hour — drains a 100K week-boundary T19 burst in
#                    ~25 min. Hard prerequisite: partial index idx_pe_next_action
#                    (task #24, patch cr_004_scale.idx_pe_next_action) so the
#                    SELECT stays <50ms at scale.
#   - 0 */2 * * *  — escalation_runner: 6-hour bulk escalation sweep (legacy
#                    batcher; will eventually be replaced by escalation_batcher
#                    in collection-mode rollout)
#   - 0 0 * * 1    — auto_advance_batch_week: weekly Monday sweep that bumps
#                    Batch.current_calendar_week and unblocks max_allowed_week
#                    on each PE
